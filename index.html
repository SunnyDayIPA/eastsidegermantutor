          Hello, my name is Shirin Niami and I have been a teacher and tutor of
          the German language for 20 years. I have helped junior high and high
          school students towards fluency as well as performed translation
          services professionally for businesses and individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I offer in person tutoring at my Home on the eastside of Seattle
          (observing safety guidelines for covid of course) and online tutoring
          for those who find it more convenient.
        </p>
